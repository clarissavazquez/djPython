djPython is an open source projecct that is used to identify musical frequencies.
The Git files can be imported into any python file and our functions can be used in other programs also.

Members of the team:
- Martin Almaraz -- Calculated the frequency of the .wav files from fft translation.
- Clarissa Vazquez -- Did all the documentation and bug tracing. Also contributed greatly to the abjad sheet music pdf makers
- Benito Sanchez -- Expanded on the musical sheet translation and allowed for more integration such as multiple notes and proper implementaion
- Manuel Rosales -- Researched and general help with code throughout the project.
